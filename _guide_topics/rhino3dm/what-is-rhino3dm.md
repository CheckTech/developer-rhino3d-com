## What is Rhino3dm?

rhino3dm is a set of standalone libraries which provide the ability to access and manipulate geometry through .NET , Python or JavaScript applications independent of Rhino.  

Functionality includes

- Create, interrogate, and store all geometry types supported in Rhino. This includes points, point clouds, NURBS curves and surfaces, polysurfaces (B-Reps), meshes, annotations, and extrusions.
- Work with non-geometry classes supported in Rhino like layers, object attributes, tranforms and viewports
- Read and write all of the above information to and from the *.3dm* file format
- Use as a client to make calls into the [Rhino Compute cloud server](https://www.rhino3d.com/compute) for advanced manipulation of geometry objects
- Available on most platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

For bug reports or feature requests see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### rhino3dm.py (Python)
**rhino3dm.py** is a python package that can be used on all current versions of CPython (both 2.7 and 3.7) and is available on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) [through PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/rhino3dm/).

`pip install rhino3dm`

See [our python documentation](RHINO3DM.PY.md) for details


### rhino3dm.js (Javascript/web assembly)

See [our javascript documentation](RHINO3DM.JS.md) for details

### Rhino3dm.NET

Rhino3dm.Net allows you to write standalone .NET applications.

See the [documentation on installing and using Rhino3dmIO packages on nuget](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/opennurbs/what-is-rhino3dmio/)

### How to Participate

The libraries are still very new and changing rapidly (with the exception of Rhino3dm.NET). Give them a try or get involved.
