Sometimes there is a need to share information between Grasshopper and Rhino.Python.  This can be done through a global [sticky variable](http://developer.rhino3d.com/samples/rhinopython/sticky-values/) creating a definition wide global sticky variable. Both Rhino.Python and gh.python use the same Python instance, so the Python sticky is shared between the two.

With a global sticky variable all the components in a definition can access the information.

As an example, here is a definition that creates a simple sticky variable and passes it to another component that is not connected:



![{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sticky-ghpython.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sticky-ghpython.png){: .img-center width="65%"}


```python
import scriptcontext as rs

rs.sticky["someName"] = x #"x" is the input for the component

```

The scriptcontext.sticky creates a global variable names "someName".  This can be referenced in another component using this code:


```python
import scriptcontext as rs

a = rs.sticky["someName"] #output the value of the sticky

```

Within Rhino.Python, the same value can be accessed the same way through [Rhino.Python sticky](http://developer.rhino3d.com/samples/rhinopython/sticky-values/).
