## Question

Is there a function to query if a loop `ON_BrepLoop` is reversed on the face `ON_BrepFace`?  In other words, whether the boundary of the face agrees with or opposes that of the corresponding loop?

Also, is there a way to query if the edge `ON_BrepEdge` direction is reversed?  Or, whether an edge curve agrees with the start and end vertices?

## Answer

Loops are always oriented so that the active region of the face is to the left of the 2D curve.  Thus, outer loops are oriented counter-clockwise and inner loops are oriented clockwise.

Also, to determine whether or not an edge is reversed, use `ON_BrepEdge::ProxyCurveIsReversed()`.  See *opennurbs_curveproxy.h* for details.
