## Overview

There has always been confusion about what exactly `ByRef` and `ByVal` mean in VBScript.  The confusion arises because VBScript uses “by reference” to mean two similar, but different things.  VBScript supports:

1. Reference types
1. Variable references

The best way to illustrate the difference is with an example.  Consider this class:

```vbnet
Class Foo
  Public Bar
End Class
```

Now we can create an instance of this class:

```vbnet
Dim Blah, Baz
Set Blah = New Foo
Set Baz = Blah
Blah.Bar = 123
```

Both `Blah` and `Baz` are references to the same object. The fourth line changes both `Blah.Bar` and `Baz.Bar` because these are different names for the same thing.

That's the “reference type” feature.  We say that VBScript treats objects as reference types.

Now consider this little program:

```vbnet
Sub Change(ByRef XYZ)
  XYZ = 5
End Sub
Dim ABC
ABC = 123
Change ABC
```

This passes a reference to variable `ABC`. The local variable `XYZ` becomes an alias for `ABC`, so the assignment `XYZ = 5` changes `ABC` as well.
