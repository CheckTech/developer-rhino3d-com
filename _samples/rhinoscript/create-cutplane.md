  cmd = "_CutPlane " & s0 & s1 & "_Enter"
  Rhino.Command cmd, 0

  ' Get the object created by CutPlane
  CreateCutPlane = Rhino.FirstObject

  ' Unselect all objects
  Rhino.UnSelectAllObjects

  ' If any objects were selected before calling
  ' this function, re-select them
  If IsArray(saved) Then Rhino.SelectObjects(saved)

  ' Don't forget to turn redrawing back on
